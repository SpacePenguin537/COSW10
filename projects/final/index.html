      <p>This portfolio mainly features my assignments and projects from the COSW10 class at LBCC. It also exhibits some of the extracurricular activities I partake in, as well as some side projects I like to work on in my free time. Look around as much as you want!</p>

          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Believe it or not, I'm actually a senior at Robert A. Millikan high school! I took the COSW10 course at LBCC in the summer of 2022 as a dual enrollment course to learn webdesign. I'm 16 years old and I live in Long Beach. I love all aspects of technology, from the Internet to coding to cybersecurity, and everything in between. I also have big passions for games, both digital and physical, and music, from playing instruments to composing songs to even just listening to music. In the future I hope to combine these skills and become a video game developer.</p>
          <p>I first learned the basics of webdesign in middle school with Adobe Dreamweaver. However, I wanted to expand my HTML and CSS skills, which is why I decided to take the COSW10 course in high school. In said course I learned many new features, such as how to gather user info using HTML forms, or how to decorate your page with CSS transitions and animations. The main idea I took away though was the importance of designing the website interface to be user friendly, using tools such as a navigation bar and the CSS box model. Webdesign is a great skill to learn, and I plan to use it in the future as a method of displaying my games to others online. As such, moving forward I'd like to learn about how to embed downloadable files in my sites, as well as how to implement a functioning online purchase feature.</p>
